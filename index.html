  <h1><b>Concepts of the Web and HTML</b></h1> 
<b>The World Wide Web</b> 
<p>The world wide web is a make up of HTML 
 documents.
Each computer browser comunicates with servers through a 
 protocol called HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
   HTTP is used by computers to communicate across 
   the world wide web. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/

 breaks down the process of communication between browsers
 and servers in an easy to understand fashion.</p> <br>
 <b>HTML</b>
 <p>HTML means Hypertext Markup language. HTML 
 is made up of text content ("what you see"), mark up 
 ("what it looks like"), references to other 
   documents (such as images or videos), and links to other pages.

 <b>Tags </b>
 <p>HTML markup is made up of tags. Tags are like keywords
   that tell a web page how to show content. HTML documents are
   made up of HTML <b>elements</b>. An element is everything
   from the opening tag to the closing tag. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/
   viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444"> Here </a> is a good
   example of tags and elements.
 </p>
 <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
 <p>An <b>Inline</b> element is an element that takes up only
   the space needed. A <b>Block</b> element creates a sort of
   invisible box around the text that is being tagged. An example of
   a block element is the P tag, or paragraph tag, which creates
   a space before and after the text that is written.
